# Clockwork

A productivity app based on the [Pomodoro Technique](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique/)

## Features

- Play, pause, and reset timer
- Background progress bar
- Settings menu
- Show/hide timer display
- Show as timer or percentage
- Set custom time

### Planned Features

These are features I'd like to add but only if I come back to this project in the future.

- Local settings saves
- Timer end audio
- Animated progress bar (something like a wavy effect on top of progress bar)
- Break timer & autostart

## Known Issues

- Warnings in build time (doesn't appear to cause any bugs)
- Gears still rotate when timer reaches 0
